  New York City, renowned for its vibrant energy and bustling streets, is
  currently grappling with a pressing issue: an alarmingly high number of
  collisions. This story delves into the concerning trend of collisions in the
  city, especially during the covid years, and highlights the urgent need for
  effective measures to address this critical matter.

<p>
  In terms of the above plot for the total collisions per year per Borough we
  can observe the following: 
  <ul>
    <li>Overall, the number of collisions in New York City has decreased from 2013 to 2022.</li>
    <li>Brooklyn consistently had the highest number of collisions each year, followed by Queens and then Manhattan.</li>
    <li>The Bronx and Staten Island had fewer collisions each year compared to the other boroughs.</li>
    <li>From 2013 to 2019, there was a gradual decrease in the number of collisions in each borough, with the exception of the Bronx, which remained relatively stable.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Overall, There was a significant decrease in collisions in 2020 compared to previous years, likely due to the 
  pandemic and decreased traffic volume. It is clear that the COVID pandemic had a significant impact on the number 
  of collisions in New York City, with a sharp decrease in 2020 due to lockdown restrictions. However, as traffic 
  volume returns to pre-pandemic levels, the number of collisions is starting to increase again.  
</p>

<p>
  All the fluctuation and changes, for every borough, seem logical, considering the lockdown laws that were imposed. 
  But if we take a look at the total number of people injured from collisions, we might discover something interesting.

<p>
  According to the above plot with total number of injuries by Borough per year the most interesting findings are the following: 
  <ul>
    <li>Overall, there has been a slight decrease in the total number of injuries from 2013 to 2022, with some fluctuations in between. 
      In 2013, there were a total of 42,990 injuries, while in 2022 there were 34,808 injuries. 
    </li>
    <li>The borough with the highest number of injuries consistently over the years is Brooklyn, followed by Queens. The borough with
         the lowest number of injuries is Staten Island.
    </li>
    <li>
      Looking specifically at the period before COVID-19 (2013-2019), there was a general downward trend in the total number of injuries for each borough, except for Manhattan, which had a slight increase. The largest decrease in injuries was seen in the Bronx, which went from 6,254 injuries in 2013 to 6,043 injuries in 2019. 
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  We would expect that the number of injuries would have a proportionate decrease as the total number of collisions, but it is not the case. Somehow, 
  even with significantly less collisions we have a high total number of injured people. Thus, the collisions in the covid period were more injurious
   compared to the collisions in the before covid period. We believe this is worth looking into and investigating.

<p>
  The map gives some valuable insight. Based on the folium map with collisions with more than 5 injuries per year in New York City, 
  it can be seen that there was a decrease in the number of such collisions in the year 2020. However, it is quite interesting to note 
  that the accidents that did occur during the Covid period (2020-2022) were more injurious (red color instead of blue color before 2020), 
  likely due to higher speeds, less traffic congestion and higher number of pedestrians and cyclists on the roads. This might clarify and unravel 
  the before mentioned mystery. Probably, most collisions, before the pandemic, were caused during rush hours, when people are either going to work
   or returning from work, and these accidents typically are not so dangerous and hardly cause any injuries.  
</p>

<p>
  The most injurious collision roads include the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, Grand Central Parkway, Cross Bronx Expressway, Belt Parkway, and FDR Drive. 
  It is crucial for policy makers to focus on improving safety measures, infrastructure and reducing speed limits on these roads to prevent such injurious 
  collisions in the future. 
</p>

<p>
  In conclusion, the alarmingly high number of injuries caused by collisions in New York City demands immediate attention and swift action. 
  With the city's crowded streets and a growing population, the risks faced by motorists, pedestrians, and cyclists are substantial. 
  By addressing the root causes, New York City can work towards creating safer roads for all.
